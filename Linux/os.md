# Operating System

## What is an OS?

An **Operating system** is software that manages a computer.
 
* It is a collection of data and programs that manages the systems (hardware) resources. 
* It accommodates the execution of application software by acting as an interface layer between the hardware and the applications (for functions such as input/output and memory related operations).

## What is Kernel?

**Kernel** is the main part of a computer **Operating system**. It is the actual bridge between the hardware and the application software. The kernel is usually responsible for the management of system resources including the hardware and software communication. It provides a very low level abstraction layer between processors and input/output devices. Inter-process communication and system calls are the main mechanisms in which these low level facilities are offered to other applications (by the kernel). 

##What is the difference between Kernel and Operating System?

Kernel is the core of the operating system. All other parts that make up the operating system (graphical user interface, file management, shell, etc.) rely on the kernel. Kernel is responsible for the communication with the hardware, and it is actually the part of the operating system that talks directly with the hardware.
